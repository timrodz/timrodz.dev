          millennials and Gen Z’ers. That means I understand some of today’s
          memes. Since I was young, computers have been a part of my life, and
          I’m grateful I work with them daily—A dream scenario!`}

          Magic: The Gathering), planning the next travel destination, or
          thinking about what to learn next. I’m currently learning Portuguese,
